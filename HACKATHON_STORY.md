# 🚀 SalesShortcut Hackathon Journey

## Inspiration

The idea for SalesShortcut came from a real-world problem we witnessed firsthand. A friend of ours was working as a freelance developer, and he partnered with a sales-savvy friend to generate new business. The process was entirely manual: the salesperson would spend hours cold-calling businesses, trying to find clients who needed a new website. When he found an interested lead, my developer friend would jump in and build the site.

It was a classic, manual grind. While their hustle was admirable, it was incredibly time-consuming and inefficient. We thought, "There has to be a better way."

This sparked the core idea behind SalesShortcut: **What if we could automate that entire process?** What if we could use the power of AI to not only find the leads but also to research them, craft personalized proposals, and even make the initial contact? We were inspired by the idea of building a system that could empower anyone, from a single developer to a small team, to create a new and significant stream of income using the incredible tools Google provides. We wanted to turn that manual hustle into a scalable, automated business engine.

## What it does

SalesShortcut is a comprehensive AI-powered Sales Development Representative (SDR) system that automates the entire sales process from lead discovery to deal closure. The system:

🔍 **Finds Leads**: Automatically discovers potential business leads in specified cities using Google Maps and location-based search, focusing on businesses without websites or with poor digital presence.

🧠 **Researches Prospects**: Conducts comprehensive business analysis to understand target business needs, pain points, competitor landscape, and opportunities through multiple specialized research agents.

📝 **Generates Proposals**: Creates personalized website development proposals based on research findings, using AI to craft compelling, tailored content that addresses specific business needs.

📞 **Makes Outreach**: Performs professional phone calls using ElevenLabs AI voice technology and sends follow-up emails with detailed proposals to interested prospects.

📋 **Manages Leads**: Tracks engagement, schedules follow-up activities, manages the sales funnel, and integrates with calendar systems for appointment scheduling.

## How we built it

SalesShortcut is not just a single application; it's a comprehensive system of **34 specialized AI agents** working in concert. We built a sophisticated multi-agent architecture using Google's cutting-edge technologies:

### 🏗️ Architecture & Scale
- **34 distinct agents** (21 LLMAgents, 7 Sequential Agents, 1 Parallel Agent, 2 Custom Agents, 1 Loop Agent)
- **5 microservices** communicating via A2A protocol
- **16+ specialized tools** including agent-as-a-tool patterns
- **Advanced agentic patterns**: Review/Critique, Iterative Refinement, Parallel Fan-Out/Gather, and Human-in-the-Loop

### 🛠️ Technology Stack
- **Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)** for agent orchestration
- **Google Cloud Run** for serverless deployment
- **Vertex AI & Gemini Models** for AI capabilities
- **Google BigQuery** for data persistence
- **Google Maps, Search, Gmail, Calendar APIs** for comprehensive functionality
- **ElevenLabs API** for natural voice conversations
- **A2A Protocol** for service-to-service communication

## Challenges we ran into

Building a system this complex presented significant challenges:

### 🎯 Orchestrating 34 Agents
Managing the state and communication flow between three dozen agents was our biggest challenge. Ensuring proper coordination, avoiding conflicts, and maintaining data consistency across all agents required sophisticated state management and advanced ADK patterns.

### ⚡ Implementing True Parallelism
Designing the fan-out/gather pattern for simultaneous lead research required careful management of asynchronous tasks and data aggregation to avoid race conditions and ensure all information was correctly processed and synchronized.

### 🔧 Dynamic Tool Invocation
Allowing agents to use other agents as tools added complexity. We had to ensure that calling agents could correctly format requests and interpret responses from agent-tools, while maintaining proper execution flow and error handling.

### 🔗 Microservices Communication
Implementing reliable A2A communication patterns across 5 services while maintaining system resilience and handling network failures, timeouts, and service dependencies.

## What we learned

Starting this project was an ambitious leap for us. We decided to build it from scratch, which meant a steep but rewarding learning curve. Our journey was a deep dive into Google's powerful suite of technologies:

### 🤖 Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK)
We were new to ADK, but we were immediately impressed by its structured approach to building complex AI agents. We learned how to effectively manage agent state, which was critical for a system where multiple AI agents need to collaborate. The logical structure and powerful features like lifecycle hooks (`before_agent`, `after_agent`, `before_tool`, `after_tool`) gave us granular control over the entire execution flow.

### 🔗 App-to-App (A2A) Communication
Building a microservices-based architecture required a robust way for our services to talk to each other. We learned how to implement efficient and reliable A2A communication patterns to ensure our agents and services were always in sync across our 2 A2A clients.

### ☁️ Google Cloud Run & Vertex AI
Deploying a multi-service application can be complex, but Cloud Run was a game-changer. We learned how to containerize and deploy our services as scalable, serverless instances. Furthermore, we explored beyond the standard APIs and learned to host and query different LLMs for our agentic brains, including models on Vertex AI, giving us ultimate flexibility.

We came away from this hackathon with a profound appreciation for the power and elegance of Google's technology. It felt like we had a set of world-class building blocks that enabled us to bring our ambitious vision to life.
