## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

1. **Virtual Environment**: Already created and activated
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Environment Configuration**:
   ```bash
   cp config.template .env
   # Edit .env with your actual API keys
   ```

3. **Required API Keys**:
   - `GOOGLE_API_KEY` - For Gemini LLM
   - `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` - For Places API
   - `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` - Your GCP Project ID

4. **Test the Integration**:
   ```bash
   python test_integrations.py
   ```

## 📂 Key Files Modified

### Lead Finder Agent - ✅ COMPLETED
- `lead_finder/lead_finder/tools/maps_search.py` - **✅ Fully implemented Google Maps integration**
- `lead_finder/lead_finder/tools/bigquery_utils.py` - **✅ Fully implemented BigQuery integration**
- `lead_finder/lead_finder/config.py` - Configuration management (uses existing)

### Other Agents (Future)
- `lead_manager/` - Lead management with BigQuery
- `outreach/` - Outreach analytics storage
- `sdr/` - Territory management and analytics

## 🎯 What Was Implemented

### Phase 1: Google Maps API Integration ✅
1. **Real API Implementation**: Complete rewrite using `googlemaps` Python library
2. **Multiple Search Types**: General search, by business type, high-rated businesses
3. **Detailed Information**: Phone numbers, websites, hours, ratings, location coordinates
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with fallback to mock data
5. **Rate Limiting**: Built-in quota management and retry logic
6. **Categorization**: Smart business category mapping from Google Places types

### Phase 2: BigQuery Integration ✅
1. **Real BigQuery Operations**: Complete replacement of JSON file operations
2. **Schema Management**: Automatic dataset and table creation with optimized schema
3. **Data Validation**: Comprehensive data cleaning and validation before insertion
4. **Deduplication**: Automatic detection and skipping of duplicate records
5. **Query Capabilities**: Flexible querying with filters (city, category, rating, status)
6. **Performance Optimization**: Table partitioning and clustering for better performance

### Phase 3: Integration & Testing ✅
1. **End-to-End Workflow**: Complete Maps search → BigQuery upload pipeline
2. **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit tests and integration tests for all components
3. **Environment Validation**: Automatic checking of API keys and configuration
4. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful degradation when APIs are unavailable

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Google Maps Search
```python
from lead_finder.tools.maps_search import google_maps_search

# Basic search
result = google_maps_search(city="San Francisco", max_results=10)

# Restaurant search  
result = google_maps_search(city="New York", business_type="restaurant", min_rating=4.0)

# High-rated businesses
result = google_maps_search(city="Boston", min_rating=4.5, max_results=20)
```

### BigQuery Operations
```python
from lead_finder.tools.bigquery_utils import bigquery_upload, bigquery_query_leads

# Upload businesses
await bigquery_upload(businesses_data, city="San Francisco", search_type="restaurant")

# Query leads
leads = await bigquery_query_leads(city="San Francisco", category="Restaurant", min_rating=4.0)
```

## 🧪 Testing

Run the comprehensive test suite:
```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Run integration tests
python test_integrations.py
```

The test suite will:
- Validate environment configuration
- Test Google Maps API integration (with fallback to mock data)
- Test BigQuery operations (with fallback to JSON files)
- Test end-to-end workflow integration
